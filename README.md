Technical Documentation Page

This is one of my first projects to ever build on my own. This was one of the capstone projects for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design ceritfication. Here are the rubrics I was asked to meet in building the project: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page My understanding of HTML attributes at that time was still pretty shaky. Coming back to it six months later is like looking at an entirely different programmer's codebase! Instead of building from scratch, I have treated refactoring as its own project.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Use a scrolling navigation bar to visit different sections on a technical documentation page about HTML.
View and navigate the page at different screen sizes

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Absolute and relative positioning
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I actually was not familiar with what technical documentation is before starting this project, so that was a good starting point. As far as building, I learned to use 'ID' tags to navigate to different parts of the web page. I learned about positioning while building a scrolling navigation bar on one side of the web page (at larger screen sizes). I learned about the '<code>' tag and HTML entities and used these quite liberally in the initial build.

### Continued development

In refactoring this page, I am learning how to leave comments for other developers when I don't understand what their code is doing. I was still shaky on responsive web design, even in this capstone project. I will be writing code to display the menu at different screen sizes. I am learning about the 'pre' tag since I want to display code snippets on the page, but the default properties associated with this tag are something that I need to investigate more. I am also trying to give this project a better UI, that is both accessible and aesthetically pleasing.
